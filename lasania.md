INGREDIENTS
1 kg boneless chicken pieces
300g yoghurt
1 heaped Tbsp ginger paste
1 Tbsp garlic paste
1/2 cup tomatoe sauce (ketchup)
1/2 cup mayonnaise
Dry spices
1 Tbsp achar powder - a mix of equal parts rye, nigella seeds, fennel and fenugreek seeds
1 1/2 tsp turmeric
1 tsp salt, to taste
1 tsp crushed red chilli, or more
1 tsp cumin powder
2 Tbsp vegetable oil
PREPARATION
Marinate the chicken with all the wet ingredients and dry spices and leave for an hour. In a heavy-based pan, heat the oil and fry the chicken mix for 10 minutes then leave on a medium to low flame to cook in the sauce created until the meat is tender and until the oil separates a little and the gravy is still slightly liquid, about 20 minutes. To garnish, sprinkle chopped fresh coriander and garam masala (optional). Serve with basmati rice.
